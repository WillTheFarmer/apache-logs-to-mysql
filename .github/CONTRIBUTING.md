Monetary :moneybag: contributions made will be reflected in development of [Web Interface](https://github.com/WillTheFarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts) for the MySQL or MariaDB `apache_logs` schema created by this application.

I volunteer at a local nonprofit organization that provides food, clothing and shelter for the poor. The Executive Director is familiar with MySQL and wanted to import their Apache website logs into MySQL tables to query data. I offered to research existing solutions that used MySQL. At the end of that meeting I knew little about Apache logs and thought it would be two or three days of my time.

As of March 2025 I have about 1200 hours :hourglass_flowing_sand: of existing solutions research and application development into this project. It is much more time then I intended to invest but it did produce my first open-source software.
