Monetary :moneybag: contributions made will encourage [Web Interface](https://github.com/WillTheFarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts) development continuation for MySQL or MariaDB schema created here. It also encourages completion [NGINX Logging](https://github.com/WillTheFarmer/nginx-logs-to-mysql) that uses same MySQL or MariaDB schema.

I volunteer at local nonprofit that provides food and clothing for those in need. The Director is familiar with MySQL and he wanted to import Apache website logs into MySQL tables. At that meeting I knew little about Apache logs but lots about MySQL. I thought it would be two or three days of my time so I offered to research existing solutions that used MySQL. Surprisingly none I found performed any data normalization and were very primitive. The lack of existing solutions led to creation of this solution.

As of March 2025 I had about 1200 hours :hourglass_flowing_sand: of researching existing solutions and application development into codebase. I stopped logging maintenance hours after that major release. It is much more time then I intended to invest but it did produce my first open-source software.
