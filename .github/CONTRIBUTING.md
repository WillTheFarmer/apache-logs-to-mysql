As of March 2025 over 1200 volunteer hours have been invested into building this application for a nonprofit organization that provides food, clothing and shelter for the poor. The Executive Director is familiar with MySQL and wanted to import their Apache website logs into MySQL tables to query data. I decided to research existing solutions that used MySQL. At the end of that meeting I thought it would be two or three days of my time.

Monetary contributions made will be reflected in development of [Web Interface](https://github.com/WillTheFarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts) for the MySQL `apache_logs` schema.
