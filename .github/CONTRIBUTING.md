This repository exists because I volunteer at local nonprofit that provides food and clothing for those in need. The Director is familiar with MySQL and wanted to import Apache website logs into MySQL tables. At that meeting I knew little about Apache logs but lots about MySQL. I thought it would be a couple days to research existing solutions and offered to investigate. Surprisingly none I found performed any data normalization and were very primitive. The lack of existing open-source relation database solutions led to creation of this solution.

March 2025 I had conservatively 1200 hours :hourglass_flowing_sand: of researching existing solutions, database design and SQL/Python development. The January 2026 Python code re-design added another 300 hours. It is much more time then I intended to invest but it did produce my first open-source software.
